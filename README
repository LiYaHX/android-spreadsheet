I have been delaying releasing this, and just decided to pull the 
trigger.  The most important feature not included is touch scrolling.  
It does scroll by arrow key (if your Android device has one).  So touch 
scrolling is the next feature to go in.

The big thing for this is Excel 2007 and 2010 format, which this does 
not have.  Even stripped down POI jar's can't go in - they exceed the 
Android Dalvik 65536 method limit.  POI can be done on Android, but it 
is a bit of a job, which is why I am putting this on Github.  And also 
to let people use code I've sort of abandoned.

Other features to do are obvious - the selected cell displayed in the 
upper left hand corner, editable cells, the ability to save a file, 
adjustable column width etc.
